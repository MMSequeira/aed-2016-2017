    // problem may be solved using instrumentation code, such as the method
    // below. This is not an elegant solution, but it works. Ideally, parts
    // would be marked with a special annotation @Part and the
    // ObjectSizeFetcher.sizeOf() would follow references or collections of
    // references thus annotated to estimate the true size of an object, i.e.,
    // including the size of its parts.
    //
    // Please take into account that parts may contain other parts. Also, take
    // care when using objects with long sequences of parts. If recursion is
    // used to find the memory use in such cases, a stack overflow error may
    // easily occurs. Prefer iteration over recursion, in these cases.

        // iteration to recursion.
