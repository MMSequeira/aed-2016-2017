     * Sorts an array using a variant of insertion sort (stable) that performs
     * moves instead of swaps. That is, the value being inserted is not swap
     * successively to the left until it fits into its place. Instead, a copy of
     * that value is stored in a temporary variable, the values of the items are
     * moved right (overlapping the value which is being inserted), and the
     * value to insert is copied from the temporary variable into the item made
     * available by the moves. When moving a value M items to the left, this
     * variant of the algorithm performs 2 array accesses (copies into and out
     * of the temporary variable) plus 2M array accesses for the moves, for a
     * total of 2M+2 ~ 2M array accesses. The variant of the algorithm using
     * swaps performs M swaps in the same case, that is, a total of 4M ~ 4M
     * array accesses. Hence, the move-based variant of insertion sort performs
     * about Â½ the number of array accesses performed by the swap-based version.
     * 
     * @param values
     *            The array to sort.
